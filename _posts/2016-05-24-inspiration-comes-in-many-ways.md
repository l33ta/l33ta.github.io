I have been reading a book called Sew Zoey and I like it. The book is about sewing and adventure. It
has inspired me to start a new sewing project. To help me decide what I should sew, I have been
drawing my designs. Here is one of them.

I can hardly wait to start sewing one of my designs with my grandmother, Siti!

The last time I was at her house we made macaroons after watching [Grace Stirs up Success](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3733678/).

By now, you are probably asking yourself how can she be inspired so often? Well it is what I do.
Grace bakes; Saige paints; and Alita dreams.

A couple more dreams of mine include baking crackles (a type of cookie), and building a selfie
station in my room.

I hope you dream big too. Till next time, bye!
