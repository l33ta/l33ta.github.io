Christmas is usually a day of surprises. You never know what presents you will get. Today included some non-present surprises too. The grown-ups, wearing red hats, gave the children white hats to wear, and challenged us to a Christmas-day competition. Seven events to determine the winner, Team Candy (us kids), or Team Weather (parents and grandparents).

The events were all fun, individual competitions. Some of the events were funnier than others, for instance, the first event required you to draw a snowman on a plate while the plate was on your head. My designated event was similar to basketball, except we used jingle bells and a wreath. Here is a complete list of the events and results.

| Event             |        Competitors       | Score |
|-------------------|:------------------------:|:-----:|
| Snowman drawing   | Tootsie Roll vs. Typhoon | 0 - 1 |
| Candy cane pickup |     Taffy vs. Tsunami    | 0 - 2 |
| Card blowing      |   Smarties vs. Typhoon   | 1 - 2 |
| Cup stacking      |     M&Ms vs. Blizzard    | 2 - 2 |
| Candy Sorting     | Cotton Candy vs. Thunder | 2 - 3 |
| Bell tossing      |   Caramello vs. Cyclone  | 3 - 3 |
| Limbo             |   Kisses vs. Lightning   | 4 - 3 |

As you can see, it was very close, but the kids won the day!
