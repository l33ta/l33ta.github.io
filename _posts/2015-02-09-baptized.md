Last week I went to a baptism class at [Community Bible Church](http://www.communitybible.com),
and yesterday I went to be baptized.  There were about 25 of us getting baptized.  I was the 
second in line, and I was really nervous.

Before we started, Pastor Scott told us the water heater did not work, and the water was going to
be really cold... so we should try not to be shocked.  When I saw the first boy come out shivering,
I knew that was no joke!

When it was my turn, I could see Papa, Mama, Alex and Siti were all very close.

Pastor Scott asked me, "Who was my Lord and Savior?" and I answered Jesus.

Then he asked me, "Are you ready to follow Him the rest of your life, no turning back?" and I answered YES.

Pastor Scott whisepered (so only I could hear) to plug my nose.  Then he gently pulled me backwards
into the water, symbolizing Jesus's death on the cross for all our sins; and he pulled me back up,
symbolizing Jesus coming back to life.  Everyone clapped and cheered!

After my turn was done, I got dressed and went to watch the others getting baptized.  I clapped and
cheered loudly for them too.  At the end, there were cookies and punch to celebrate.

We continued the party at Siti and Habibi's house with dinner and pound cake for dessert!

What a fun day!
